	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}), sensors networks, and Internet of Things ({IoT}) are the most important contributor in the newest revolution in the industry. It is going towards a fully automated industrial environment where all the components including post production, pre production, supply chain and quality control would be automatically managed. Human will work more with brain, where all the physical efforts would be replaced by {ML} enabled intelligent robots that will perform all the tasks, where sensor networks will collect live information from the environment. All the decision would be taken on the fly from the previous records. In this work, we have tried to shed some light on the current involvement of {ML} and {IoT} in industry 4.0 environment. 28 articles were reviewed in this work which were selected through a selection process and were published between 2017 and 2022. Different tools, protocols, algorithms and the latest technologies used in the industry 4.0 environment have been analytically discussed in this work. Research gaps were tried to found out and some recommendations were provided which can be a pathway to research advancement related to industry 4.0.},

	abstract = {The recent advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}) have affected several research fields, leading to improvements that could not have been possible with conventional optimization techniques. Among the sectors where {AI}/{ML} enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things ({IIoT}), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in {ML}-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the {ML} algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of {ML} in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of {ML}-based human–machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.},

            With the ongoing digitization of the manufacturing industry and the ability to bring together data from manufacturing processes and quality measurements, there is enormous potential to use machine learning and deep learning techniques for quality assurance. In this context, predictive quality enables manufacturing companies to make data-driven estimations about the product quality based on process data. In the current state of research, numerous approaches to predictive quality exist in a wide variety of use cases and domains. Their applications range from quality predictions during production using sensor data to automated quality inspection in the field based on measurement data. However, there is currently a lack of an overall view of where predictive quality research stands as a whole, what approaches are currently being investigated, and what challenges currently exist. This paper addresses these issues by conducting a comprehensive and systematic review of scientific publications between 2012 and 2021 dealing with predictive quality in manufacturing. The publications are categorized according to the manufacturing processes they address as well as the data bases and machine learning models they use. In this process, key insights into the scope of this field are collected along with gaps and similarities in the solution approaches. Finally, open challenges for predictive quality are derived from the results and an outlook on future research directions to solve them is provided.},

	abstract = {The quality-control process in manufacturing must ensure the product is free of defects and performs according to the customer’s expectations. Maintaining the quality of a firm’s products at the highest level is very important for keeping an edge over the competition. To maintain and enhance the quality of their products, manufacturers invest a lot of resources in quality control and quality assurance. During the assembly line, parts will arrive at a constant interval for assembly. The quality criteria must first be met before the parts are sent to the assembly line where the parts and subparts are assembled to get the final product. Once the product has been assembled, it is again inspected and tested before it is delivered to the customer. Because manufacturers are mostly focused on visual quality inspection, there can be bottlenecks before and after assembly. The manufacturer may suffer a loss if the assembly line is slowed down by this bottleneck. To improve quality, state-of-the-art sensors are being used to replace visual inspections and machine learning is used to help determine which part will fail. Using machine learning techniques, a review of quality assessment in various production processes is presented, along with a summary of the four industrial revolutions that have occurred in manufacturing, highlighting the need to detect anomalies in assembly lines, the need to detect the features of the assembly line, the use of machine learning algorithms in manufacturing, the research challenges, the computing paradigms, and the use of state-of-the-art sensors in Industry 4.0.},

Despite the intensive support for building {ML} applications, there are still challenges when it comes to evaluating, assuring, and improving the quality or dependability. The difficulty stems from the unique nature of {ML}, namely, system behavior is derived from training data not from logical design by human engineers. This leads to black-box and intrinsically imperfect implementations that invalidate many principles and techniques in traditional software engineering. In light of this situation, the Japanese industry has jointly worked on a set of guidelines for the quality assurance of {AI} systems (in the Consortium of Quality Assurance for {AI}-based Products and Services) from the viewpoint of traditional quality-assurance engineers and test engineers. We report on the second version of these guidelines, which cover a list of quality evaluation aspects, catalogue of current state-of-the-art techniques, and domain-specific discussions in five representative domains. The guidelines provide significant insights for engineers in terms of methodologies and designs for tests driven by application-specific requirements.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning ({ML}) have recently been radically improved and are now being employed in almost every application domain to develop automated or semi-automated systems. To facilitate greater human acceptability of these systems, explainable artificial intelligence ({XAI}) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years with the development of highly accurate models but with a paucity of explainability and interpretability. The literature shows evidence from numerous studies on the philosophy and methodologies of {XAI}. Nonetheless, there is an evident scarcity of secondary studies in connection with the application domains and tasks, let alone review studies following prescribed guidelines, that can enable researchers’ understanding of the current trends in {XAI}, which could lead to future research for domain- and application-specific method development. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review ({SLR}) on the recent developments of {XAI} methods and evaluation metrics concerning different application domains and tasks. This study considers 137 articles published in recent years and identified through the prominent bibliographic databases. This systematic synthesis of research articles resulted in several analytical findings: {XAI} methods are mostly developed for safety-critical domains worldwide, deep learning and ensemble models are being exploited more than other types of {AI}/{ML} models, visual explanations are more acceptable to end-users and robust evaluation metrics are being developed to assess the quality of explanations. Research studies have been performed on the addition of explanations to widely used {AI}/{ML} models for expert users. However, more attention is required to generate explanations for general users from sensitive domains such as finance and the judicial system.},

Recent breakthroughs in machine learning ({ML}) provide unique opportunities, but only joint interdisciplinary research between the {ML} and chemical engineering ({CE}) communities will unfold the full potential. We identify six challenges that will open new methods for {CE} and formulate new types of problems for {ML}: (1) optimal decision making, (2) introducing and enforcing physics in {ML}, (3) information and knowledge representation, (4) heterogeneity of data, (5) safety and trust in {ML} applications, and (6) creativity.

            Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in Artificial Intelligence ({AI})-based methodological development in a broad range of domains. In this rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning ({ML}) and Deep Learning ({DL}) models. Majority of these models are inherently complex and lacks explanations of the decision making process causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and safety, is the difficulty in interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these {AI} models, explaining their learning and decision making process are getting harder which require transparency and easy predictability. Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the explainable {AI} ({XAI}) models. To reduce false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models, finding flaws in them is still difficult and inefficient. In this paper, the development of {XAI} is reviewed meticulously through careful selection and analysis of the current state-of-the-art of {XAI} research. It also provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the {XAI} frameworks and their efficacy to serve as a starting point of {XAI} for applied and theoretical researchers. Towards the end, it highlights emerging and critical issues pertaining to {XAI} research to showcase major, model-specific trends for better explanation, enhanced transparency, and improved prediction accuracy.},

            This paper provides a brief analytical review of the current state‐of‐the‐art in relation to the explainability of artificial intelligence in the context of recent advances in machine learning and deep learning. The paper starts with a brief historical introduction and a taxonomy, and formulates the main challenges in terms of explainability building on the recently formulated National Institute of Standards four principles of explainability. Recently published methods related to the topic are then critically reviewed and analyzed. Finally, future directions for research are suggested.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Nowadays, artificial intelligence ({AI}) systems make predictions in numerous high stakes domains, including credit-risk assessment and medical diagnostics. Consequently, {AI} systems increasingly affect humans, yet many state-of-the-art systems lack transparency and thus, deny the individual’s “right to explanation”. As a remedy, researchers and practitioners have developed explainable {AI}, which provides reasoning on how {AI} systems infer individual predictions. However, with recent legal initiatives demanding comprehensive explainability throughout the (development of an) {AI} system, we argue that the pre-processing stage has been unjustifiably neglected and should receive greater attention in current efforts to establish explainability. In this paper, we focus on introducing explainability to an integral part of the pre-processing stage: feature selection. Specifically, we build upon design science research to develop a design framework for explainable feature selection. We instantiate the design framework in a running software artifact and evaluate it in two focus group sessions. Our artifact helps organizations to persuasively justify feature selection to stakeholders and, thus, comply with upcoming {AI} legislation. We further provide researchers and practitioners with a design framework consisting of meta-requirements and design principles for explainable feature selection.},
